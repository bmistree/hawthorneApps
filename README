The hawthorneApps repository contains several useful larger-scale
emerson applictions.

These can be used either as standalones, or as examples for further
application development.


Melville IM
--------------
Instant messaging client that attempts to chat with all visibles
within proximity set.  If two visibles agree to chat with each
other, then melville sends messages between them that display in their
graphical interface.  Can also set up rooms where multi-cast chat
messages to lots of users.


Tiresias
--------------
A script that begins a graphical tutorial of how to do things in the
world (script, etc.).

Maybe interface to some type of http requests for chatting with
chatbot or something?
