Tiresias is a guide around our virtual world.  He presents very basic
information about how to navigate in the world, what the world is, how
the world actually works (and maybe some examples of how it's
different from other systems), what is going on within the world
(eg. "We should go over to point X, you can meet someone else there"), how
to script things in the world, a "do something cool" option
(eg. release birds), details about particular world ("right now, we
are passing the Z building"), etc.  


Potential options:

Release the birds.
What is this?  Where am I?
Key controls.
Do something cool!
Maybe hook into chat bot, or something?
Hide Tiresias.
What is that?
Be a guide for me.  (Says things, like, "look over there, X,Y, or Z is
happening".)

What are the scripting apis?  (Just point to their urls.)
Example of sandboxing.
